						Karlton Miko Tyack</h2>
                    <p> I have a distinct memory from when I was interning at a major publication during the mid-aughts. One of the fashion editors was assigned to interview style bloggers. I wondered why a major publication would be interested in this then-primitive medium.

						Fast-forward two decades later, and it’s no longer the major magazines that are tastemaking in culture, fashion, and the arts. It’s the bloggers, influencers, and social media personalities. 
						
						The former is a fantasy; the latter is a practical resource to gather information and real-life inspiration.
						
						If you really want to learn about shoes and footwear fashion in an authentic way, you need to keep up with the niche!
						
						I’ve pulled together a list of genuinely good shoe blogs for footwear fans to check out. These are some of my favorite sites for shoe newbies and experts alike, and each has a distinct offering that makes it stand out.
						
						Beyond that, since anyone can start a blog, I chose ones with a level of earned esteem. Some are written by true masters, others by trusted researchers, and others just by open, honest enthusiasts. There’s something here for everyone.</p>
